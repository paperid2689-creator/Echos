This file contains the code used to obtain the results for the ablation studies. In this file, we compare three different contrastive losses: supervised contrastive loss, N-pair loss, and the proposed symmetric contrastive loss. We also compare two temperature strategies: a fixed temperature and a learnable temperature.
The experiments are conducted on three datasets: the Vimedix phantom dataset, the Cactus dataset, and human echocardiography data.
